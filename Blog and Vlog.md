### Let Me Read a Poem For You

> If by life you were deceived,  
> Don't be dismal, don't be wild!  
> In the day of grief, be mild  
> Merry days will come, believe.
> 
> Heart is living in tomorrow;  
> Present is dejected here;  
> In a moment, passes sorrow;  
> That which passes will be dear.

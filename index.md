I’m a doctoral researcher from the Department of Marketing at Aalto University. 

My research revolves around the impact of digital transformation on individual well-being. 

Motivated by the call for “Better Business, Better Society”, I embarked on my doctoral journey with a firm belief that marketing has the potential to improve lives, sustain livelihoods, and strengthen societies. 

I like hiking, running, folksongs, and cooking food in Cantonese/Sichuan style.

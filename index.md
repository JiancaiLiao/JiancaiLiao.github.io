Iâ€™m a doctoral researcher in the Marketing department at Aalto University. My research interests are mainly concentrated on healthcare marketing.

I explore healthcare marketing topics (consumer non-adherence, stigmatization of patients, etc) with mixed methods, such as experiments, modeling, meta-analysis, text mining, etc.

I like reading, folksongs, going to the gym, and cooking food in Cantonese/Sichuan style.

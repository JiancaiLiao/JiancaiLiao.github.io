# About

I am an Assistant Professor in Marketing at [Birmingham Business School](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/business), University of Birmingham. I am currently a Visiting Scholar at [SCANCOR](https://scancor.stanford.edu/), Stanford University (December 2025 – March 2026).

I received my PhD in Marketing from Aalto University School of Business (Finland) in 2025. During my doctoral studies, I held visiting positions at Virginia Tech (USA) and City University of Hong Kong.

## Research Interests

My research investigates how digital transformation reshapes service experiences and consumer well-being. I pursue three interconnected streams:

- **Healthcare Services**: Patient adherence, value co-creation, pharmaceutical policy, and health management interventions
- **AI in Services**: AI disclosure structures, human-AI interaction, algorithmic transparency, and consumer trust
- **Platform-based Services**: Digital health platforms, telemedicine, physician multihoming, and platform governance

I employ diverse methodologies including laboratory and field experiments, econometric modeling (DID, causal ML), meta-analysis, and text mining.

## Teaching

At Birmingham, I teach *Marketing and New Technology* (Undergraduate) and supervise MSc dissertations and company projects. My teaching philosophy centres on creating value beyond knowledge transfer—helping students build social connections, develop critical thinking, and gain hands-on experience applying marketing to real-world problems.

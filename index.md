Iâ€™m a Ph.D. candidate in the Marketing Department at Aalto University. My research interests are mainly concentrated on how companies and governments increase consumer well-being.

I explore consumer well-being topics (consumer adherence, health marketing, healthcare policy, patients' stigma, etc.) with mixed methods, such as experiments, modeling, meta-analysis, text mining, etc.

I like folksongs, Chinese medicine, and cooking food in Cantonese style.

## Research Interests

My research investigates how digital transformation reshapes service experiences and consumer well-being. I pursue three interconnected streams:

- **Healthcare Services**: Patient adherence, value co-creation, pharmaceutical policy, and health management interventions
- **AI in Services**: AI disclosure structures, human-AI interaction, algorithmic transparency, and consumer trust
- **Platform-based Services**: Digital health platforms, telemedicine, physician multihoming, and platform governance

I employ diverse methodologies including laboratory and field experiments, econometric modeling (DID, causal ML), meta-analysis, and text mining.

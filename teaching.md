# Teaching

## Teaching Philosophy

My teaching philosophy centres on creating value beyond knowledge transfer. I design courses where students:

- **Build social connections** through collaborative discussions and peer networks
- **Develop critical thinking** through structured, memorable lectures
- **Gain hands-on experience** applying marketing concepts to real problems they encounter daily
- **Discover passion** for using marketing to solve societal challenges

I believe students should feel that missing class means missing valuable perspectives they cannot find elsewhere.

## Current Courses (University of Birmingham)
